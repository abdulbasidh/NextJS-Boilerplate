## Philosophy

- It provides a easy starting to your project in seconds with using industry-standard best practices and performance oriented tools & libraries.

## Next.js Integration

OpenDaVinci's NextJS  makes it easier to get up and running with a well-structured Next.js application.

Next.js is a minimalistic React framework that runs on the browser and the server  with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. It offers developers an easy way to get started, build server-side rendering and static web applications using React.

## Plugins
This Boilerplate uses a plugin-based architecture. Basically, plugins are created from highly-demanded npm tools in the front-end ecosystem with configuration files.
